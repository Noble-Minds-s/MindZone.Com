      <h6> INVETING FROM THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND YOU </h6>

      <p class="date"> <b>

        Innovation doesn’t always come from expensive labs or big cities-sometimes,
        it’s born in dusty villages, under trees, or with recycled tools. <br> <br>
       
        Take for example Kelvin Doe, a 13-year-old from Sierra Leone, who built a
        radio station from scrap parts. Without electricity at home, he found wires,
        speakers, batteries, and made it work. 
        He didn’t wait for opportunity-he built it. <br> <br>
 
        The message is simple: look around you - your environment might already
        be holding the tools for your next invention.Whether it’s broken electronics,
        old wood, bottle cap.
       </p>
    
      <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"start where you are, what you have.The word is looking forward for 
        your knowledge."</em>
