    <p>Malawi have brilliant minds-but too often, they're discouvering too late.</p>
    <p>In our schools,we introduce subjects....but not purpose.we teach theory but not 
        technology.As a results,many students ends up studying careers at university that they 
        don't match their passion or potertial - and that's a huge waste of time,talent,and 
        national progress.
    </p> 
    <p>What if early introduction of ; <br> <br>
     
        •Tech in schools- to teach coding & creativity early. <br>
        •Digital libralies - so students access knowledge anytime,anywhere <br>
        •Local-made softwares - to manage farms,hospitals,schools. <br>
        •Innovative hubs- where youth build,test & launch ideas. <br>
        Just to mention few.
        
    </p>
    <p>we don't need for to wait for a help.we can build our own change.
        The earlier we invest in the
        minds of our youth,the faster malawi moves forward.</p>

        itt's people-right here,right now."</em></p>

     <h6>INVETING FROM THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND YOU</h6>
     <p class="date"> <b> 
        15 June,2025 &nbsp; | &nbsp;  inspired by: Kelvin Doe's story </b>
     </p>


    <p>Innovation doesn’t always come from expensive labs or big cities-sometimes,
    it’s born in dusty villages, under trees, or with recycled tools.
    </p>
    <p>Take for example Kelvin Doe, a 13-year-old from Sierra Leone, who built a
    radio station from scrap parts. Without electricity at home, he found wires,
    speakers, batteries, and made it work. 
    He didn’t wait for opportunity-he built it.</p>
    <p>The message is simple: look around you - your environment might already
     be holding the tools for your next invention.Whether it’s broken electronics,
      old wood, bottle cap.</p>
    <P><Em>"start where you are, what you have.The word is looking forward for 
        your knowledge."</Em></P>

    <p><h6><b>THE MOMENT I ALMOST QUITE PROGRAMMING</b></h6>

         </p>
   
    
    <p>There was a time I felt completely lost in my programming journey. 
        Learning on my own, I faced bugs, confusion, and slow progress and I nearly gave up.</p>

    <p>
        But I reminded myself why I started: to build, to create, to make a difference.
          I paused… but I didn’t quit.</p>

    <p> Today, I’m still growing. I’ve developed this website as a proof of my progress, 
        along with life-changing softwares like Modern Library, SmartSchool Pro,
         and Empowering the Youth website.Just to mention few.</p>
