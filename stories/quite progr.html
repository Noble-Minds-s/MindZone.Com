    <p>There was a time I felt completely lost in my programming journey. 
        Learning on my own, I faced bugs, confusion, and slow progress and I nearly gave up.</p>

    <p>
        But I reminded myself why I started: to build, to create, to make a difference.
          I paused… but I didn’t quit.</p>

    <p> Today, I’m still growing. I’ve developed this website as a proof of my progress, 
        along with life-changing softwares like Modern Library, SmartSchool Pro,
         and Empowering the Youth website.Just to mention few.</p>
